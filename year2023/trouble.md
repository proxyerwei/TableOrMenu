It's the time 2022.07.18, I join the other team. But I still get into some troble.    
# 1 Ask question in a chatting-group, but no repsonse    
I ask a question in a chatting-group, just about the business, but no response me. But onecetime, I fund that they really see the question, but they do don't want to answer me. Why? Just becanse I'm the new member here? Or a competition to them? But you still tell nongthing to your superior! What a coward!       

# 2. Ask question by texting someone privately, but still don't work. 
The man I ask is Lei YXXXX. I get nongthing response from he. Fuck! What a coward! But you still tell nongthing to your superior!      

# 3. The worst trouble I have eccounter
